# OpenCL
Here you can find my OpenCL matrix multiplication kernel files

This project involved writing a kernel to be excecuted on a remote GPU. The kernel was set up using C++ and written in OpenCL, leveraging OpenCL's heterogenious architecture. The execution speeds of executing the matrix multiplication algorithm kernel on a GPU and then on a GPCPU were compared.
